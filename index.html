            <p class="highlight center-this">I’ve been living in Canada for 7 years now apart from my family in Korea. I spent my high school life in Vancouver until I moved to Toronto for college. From my childhood, I’ve always been interested in learning English through travelling several countries. Especially after experiencing few months of living in Australia, I was more into exploring not only a new language but also an interesting culture totally different from my country. Since then, I’ve decided to come to Canada for school and studied hard for English so that I could adapt myself in a new environment without my parents. </p>
            <p class="highlight center-this">Although I had interests in various career paths, interaction design caught my attention. While the job is one of the rising markets nowadays, the fact that it’s not just designing UI but involves interacting with users and products caught my attentions. After more searches, I liked that this career could challenge me to learn and grow constantly in thinking critically, expressing my ideas and communicating with people. Hence, I chose Interactive Design program from George Brown College which could offer me great courses and great opportunity to experience the bigger city, Toronto.  </p>

            <p class="highlight">Although I’m a homebody, I enjoy going new cafes with different vibes, taste of coffees, and interiors with my friends. We hang out, talk, and do assignments. However, whenever I visit Korea, I spend most of my days with my dog, Ggumi. I love to take a walk with him as it makes me feel like home.</p>
